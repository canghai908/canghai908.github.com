<p>We are pleased to announce the immediate availability of CentOS-6.4<br />
install media for i386 and x86_64 Architectures. Release Notes for 6.4<br />
are available at http://wiki.centos.org/Manuals/ReleaseNotes/CentOS6.4 -<br />
we recommend everyone looks through those once.</p>

<p>CentOS-6.4 is based on the upstream release EL 6.4 and includes packages<br />
from all variants. All upstream repositories have been combined into<br />
one, to make it easier for end users to work with.<!--more--></p>

<p>There are many fundamental changes in this release, compared with the<br />
past CentOS-6 releases, and we highly recommend everyone stufy the<br />
Release Notes as well as the upstream Techical Notes about the changes<br />
and how they might impact your installation.</p>

<p>All updates released since upstream 6.4 release are also released to the<br />
CentOS-6.4 mirrors.</p>

<p>Everyone who has centos-cr repositories enabled and in use, would<br />
already be running CentOs-6.4 as of two weeks ago and will notice only<br />
the centos-release rpm update with this release.</p>

<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
Upgrading from CentOS-4 or CentOS-5:</p>

<p>We recommend everyone run through a reinstall rather than attempt an<br />
inplace upgrade from CentOS-4 or CentOS-5.</p>

<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
Upgrading from CentOS-6.0 / 6.1 / 6.2 or 6.3</p>

<p>Unless you have edited your yum configs, a 'yum update' should move your<br />
machine seamlessly from any previous CentOS-6.x release to CentOS-6.4</p>

<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
Downloading CentOS-6.4 for new installs:</p>

<p>When possible, consider using torrents to run the downloads. Usually its<br />
also the fastest means to download the distro.</p>

<p>Torrent files for the DVD's are available at :<br />
http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6.4/isos/i386/CentOS-6.4-i386-bin-DVD1to2.torrent<br />
http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6.4/isos/x86_64/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-bin-DVD1to2.torrent</p>

<p>You can also use a mirror close to you :<br />
http://www.centos.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=30</p>

<p>Most mirrors will allow direct DVD downloads over http, ftp and rsync.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that not all mirrors are currently updated, some<br />
might take upto another 24 hours before they have all the content.</p>

<p>We have also made efforts to try and ensure that most install types and<br />
roles can be run from DVD-1 itself.</p>

<p>We will be releasing the LiveCD and LiveDVD images in the next few days<br />

Getting Help:</p>

<p>The best place to start when looking for help with CentOS is at the wiki<br />
( http://wiki.centos.org/GettingHelp ) which lists various options and<br />
communities who might be able to help. If you think there is a bug in<br />
the system, do report it at http://bugs.centos.org/ - but keep in mind<br />
that the bugs system is *not* a support mechanism.</p>

<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
Metups and training sessions</p>

<p>In the next few days we will be announcing CentOS Dojo's to be held in<br />
different parts of the world. These will be one day events, focused on<br />
systems and operations issues and will have talks as well as tutorials.<br />
The aim being to encourage best practises, build social communities<br />
around the CentOS user base and to encourage conversations around the<br />
issues that CentOS users care about the most. Keep a lookup for a Dojo<br />
coming to a city near you or jump in and help organise one.</p>

<p>At this point we have plans to organise events in Antwerp, Beligum;<br />
Phoenix, USA; New York City, USA; Sao Paolo, Brazil and London, UK. If<br />
you would like to get involved in helping organising, running,<br />
presenting or sponsoring a Dojo or even just want more detail do get in<br />
touch with us at the CentOS Promo list ( http://lists.centos.org/ )</p>

<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
Contributing and joining the project:</p>

<p>We are always looking for people to join and help with various things in<br />
the project. If you are keen to help out a good place to start is the<br />
wiki page at http://wiki.centos.org/Contribute . If you have questions<br />
or a specific area you would like to contribute towards that is not<br />
covered on that page, feel free to drop in on<br />
#centos-devel at irc.freenode.net for a chat or email the centos-devel list<br />
(http://lists.centos.org).</p>

<p>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br />
Thanks to everyone who contributed towards making CentOS 6.4, specially<br />
the effort put in, as always, by the QA team.</p>

<p>A special shout out to all the donors who have contributed hardware,<br />
network connectivity, hosting and resources over the years. The CentOS<br />
project now has a fairly well setup resource pool, purely thanks to the<br />
donors.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
